# D-s2048
2048 is a popular puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli in 2014. Played on a 4x4 grid, the goal is to merge tiles with matching numbers to reach a tile with a value of 2048. Players swipe in four directions to move tiles, causing same-numbered tiles to merge into one with their sum. The game ends when a 2048 tile is made or the grid is full.
